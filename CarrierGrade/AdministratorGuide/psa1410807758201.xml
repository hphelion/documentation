 <title >System Backups</title>
 <shortdesc >The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade provides tools to back up <term
      >system data</term> so that they can be stored in external storage resources and
    used to restore a full cluster.</shortdesc>

  <p >The backup and restore procedures can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <ul id="ul_at2_h3y_lp">
   <li >
    <p >Log in as user <codeph >wrsroot</codeph> to the
          console of the active controller.</p>
   </li>
   <li >
    <p >Execute the backup procedures from the CLI. The backup files are stored in the directory
      <filepath >/opt/backups</filepath> on the current controller node.</p>
   </li>
   <li >
    <p >Copy the backup files to an external storage resource.</p>
   </li>
   <li >
    <p >Shut down the cluster, and proceed with any maintenance operations that might
     be required. Ensure that all hosts are powered down.</p>
   </li>
   <li >
    <p >Restore the cluster one host at a time. Start with the first controller, then
          the second controller, then compute nodes.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
    <p >It is important to note that a restore operation must be executed on the same
      cluster hardware where the backups were created, otherwise, the operation fails. Hardware
      differences affect the restore operation in multiple ways. For example, differences in
      Ethernet MAC addresses impact the networking metadata stored in the system data backup files. </p>
  <p >The backup and restore tools are designed to operate on an entire cluster. They
      are not suitable as a tool to back up and restore individual hosts.</p>
