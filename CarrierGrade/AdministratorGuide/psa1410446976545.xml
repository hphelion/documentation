    <title >Installing Patches</title>


    <shortdesc >Patches in the patch storage area can be selected to be installed to


        the cluster, one, several, or all patches at a time. When selected, they are moved into the


        software updates repository from where they must be subsequently installed on each impacted


        host in the cluster.</shortdesc>

            <p >Installing a patch to the cluster means installing it to each and


                every host of the type where the patch is relevant. For example, one patch can be


                installed on the controller nodes only, while another can be installed on all host


                types. Since a patch is not necessarily installed on all applicable hosts


                simultaneously, patching the entire cluster can take some time.</p>


            <p >As a patch is installed to the cluster, it goes through the following


                state transitions:</p>

                            applicable hosts.</p>


                        <p >Use the command <i>wrs-patch


                                apply</i> to trigger this transition. The patch moves from the


                            patch storage area to the software updates repository and becomes ready


                            to be installed on the applicable hosts.</p>


                    </dd>

                            applicable hosts in the cluster. The transition to the <i >Applied</i> state is complete when the patch is


                            installed on all target hosts.</p>
