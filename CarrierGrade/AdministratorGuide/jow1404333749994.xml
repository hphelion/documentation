    <shortdesc ixia_locid="2">Storage resources on the controller are used to maintain internal
        databases, and to provide storage for virtual machines. For VMs, it is highly recommended to
        use storage provided through volumes (Cinder service backed by 3PAR). There might not be
        enough storage on compute nodes (especially blades). </shortdesc>

        <p ixia_locid="4">During HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade software installation, the controller configuration
            script gives you the options to allocate space on the controller for the internal
            database, and for general storage volumes (images and disk space for the virtual
            machines).</p>
        <p ixia_locid="5">The size of the database grows with the number system resources created by
            the system administrator and the tenants. This includes objects of all kinds such as
            compute nodes, provider networks, images, flavors, tenant networks, subnets, virtual
            machine instances and NICs. As a reference point, consider the following deployment
            scenario:</p>
        <ul id="ul_drv_fjf_4n">
            <li ixia_locid="6">
                <p ixia_locid="7">two controllers</p>
            </li>
            <li ixia_locid="8">
                <p ixia_locid="9">four compute nodes with dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz each.</p>
            </li>
            <li ixia_locid="10">
                <p ixia_locid="11">40 virtual machine instances</p>
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p ixia_locid="16">The size of the database in this case is approximately 9 GB. With a
            suggested default of 20 GB, there is still plenty of room to grow. However, you should
            periodically monitor the size of the database to ensure that it does not become a
            bottleneck when delivering new services.</p>
        <p ixia_locid="17">For general storage, the default settings suggested during the controller
            configuration script are recommended to utilize the maximum available space on the
            storage media.</p>
