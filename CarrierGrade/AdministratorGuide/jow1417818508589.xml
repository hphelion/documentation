  <p ixia_locid="5">You can define and monitor performance thresholds for metrics such as memory
   usage or CPU activity, and then add or remove resources when the thresholds are crossed. This
   allows you to make efficient use of the hardware in the cluster, by allocating resources only
   when they are needed, and assigning them where they are most required.</p>
