This sends configuration instructions to      the instance at launch. For an example of user data, see the <filepath >CPUScale.yaml</filepath> template included with the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade.</p>  <p >Normally, this requires <libraryname >cloud-init</libraryname> to      be installed in the guest, because the user data is converted to MIME format and then      interpreted by <libraryname >cloud-init</libraryname>. For instances that do not      include <libraryname >cloud-init</libraryname>, you can bypass the MIME      conversion of user data by invoking a HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade extension property and      assigning the value <b >'RAW'</b>. This allows the VM to      retrieve the specified user data in unaltered format through a simple REST API call to the      metadata server. The name of the property follows the convention for the associated resource      type. For an AWS resource (for example, <b         >AWS::EC2::Instance</b>), use <parmname >UserDataType</parmname>.      For an OpenStack resource (for example, <b         >OS::Nova::Server</b>), use <parmname >user_data_type</parmname>.      The following code fragment shows the property used with an AWS resource.</p>  <codeblock >type : AWS::EC2::Instance. . .UserDataType: 'RAW'UserData:        Fn::Base64:          Fn::Replace:          - 'AWS::StackName': {Ref: 'AWS::StackName'}            'AWS::Region': {Ref: 'AWS::Region'}            'AWS::AccessKey': {Ref: 'WebServerKeys'}            'AWS::SecretKey': {"Fn::GetAtt": [WebServerKeys, SecretAccessKey]}          - |. . .</codeblock>    <note id="note_N10063_N1001F_N10001" >      <p >For a VM to access user data, it must have a DHCP-enabled interface on a        tenant network that has a Neutron router.

The Neutron router provides a route to the metadata server,        which provides instances with access to user data.</p>    </note> </body></topic>
