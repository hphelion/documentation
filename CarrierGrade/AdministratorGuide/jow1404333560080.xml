        <p ixia_locid="5">HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade brings together the flexibility and scalability of the IT
            cloud, and the high-availability and performance demanded by the Telecommunications
            industry, into a unique carrier grade, industry-leading solution to deliver a
            price-performance ratio well above alternative solutions. HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is aligned
            with the ETSI-NFV architecture.</p>
