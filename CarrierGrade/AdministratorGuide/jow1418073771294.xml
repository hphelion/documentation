  <p ixia_locid="9">This is an optional script running on the guest. If present, it can modify
            aspects of scaling behavior. For example, it can control which CPU is taken offline
            during a scale-down operation, overriding the default selection. </p>
        <p ixia_locid="10">It can also call other scripts or programs. You can use this to coordinate
            or manage processing work for the vCPUs as you scale them.</p>
  <p ixia_locid="8">For more about the App Scale Helper script, refer to the documentation for the
            HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Software Development Kit.</p>
