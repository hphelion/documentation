For each exposed virtual Ethernet                device, formally referred to as a <term >Virtual Function</term>                (VF), the SR-IOV interface provides separate management memory space, work queues,                interrupts resources, and DMA streams, while utilizing common resources behind the                host interface. Each VF therefore has direct access to the hardware and can be                considered to be an independent Ethernet interface.</p>            <p >When compared with a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, a SR-IOV Ethernet                interface:</p>            <ul id="ul_tyq_ymg_rr">                <li >                    <p >Provides benefits similar to those of a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface,                        including lower latency packet processing.</p>                </li>                <li >                    <p >Scales up more easily in a virtualized environment by providing multiple VFs                        that can be attached to multiple virtual machine interfaces.</p>                </li>                <li >                    <p >Shares the same limitations, including the lack of support for LAG, QoS, ACS,                        and live migration.</p>                </li>                <li >                    <p >Has the same requirements regarding the VLAN configuration of                        the access switches.</p>                </li>                <li >                    <p >Provides a similar configuration workflow when used on HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade.</p>                </li>            </ul>            <p >It is suggested that you read <xref href="psa1413402160578.xml" /> first.
