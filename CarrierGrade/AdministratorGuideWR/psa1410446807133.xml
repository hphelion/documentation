<systemoutput >PATCH_0001:


    Patch State:    Available


    Release Status: Released


    Summary:        Add logs to hbsClient and libalarm-clock


    Description:    Modified log in hbsClient. Expect to see this log on


                    all blade types  'hbsClient patches by


                    PATCH_0001' when hbsClient


                    restarts. Also added a log to ac_init() function


                    that reads "PATCH_0001 patched


                    libalarm-clock".  Should be seen when heartbeat


                    process is restarted on controller and compute.
