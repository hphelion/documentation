It has been placed in the map, but commented out. We need to confirm how you can examine the resources for a NUMA node. Also, some of the material depends on capabilities proposed in Sprint R2-S4, but not actually available yet (Configuring NUMA Node Allocations for a VM). The topics for those capabilities may also be commented out. Be aware that this could lead to map validation issues.         -->    <title >Viewing NUMA Node Resources on a Host</title>    <shortdesc >You can use the CLI <!-- or GUI --> to display the NUMA node resources for a        host.</shortdesc>    <prolog>        <author >Jim Owens</author>    </prolog>    <body>        <section id="section_N1001F_N1001C_N10001" >            <p >Host NUMA nodes can be <term >pinned</term>, or                assigned for use by VMs. For example, a VM can be configured to use NUMA node 0, so                that when the VM is launched or migrated, the virtual machine scheduler locates a                host node with an available NUMA node 0, and dedicates that NUMA node for use by the                VM. For more about pinning NUMA nodes, see <xref href="jow1425236723556.xml" />.</p>            <p >The resources of the pinned NUMA node, including the number of                available CPUS and the available memory, must be sufficient to meet the requirements                of the VM, which can be specified independently. (For more about specifying NUMA                node requirements for a VM, see <xref href="jow1425236666266.xml" />.) To ensure that                a given host NUMA node can support the VM requirements, you can review the CPU and                memory complements for host NUMA nodes.</p>            <p >To view the CPU complement for a NUMA Node (that is, for a socketed                physical processor), use the vm-topology command. For details, see <xref href="jow1404333768530.xml" />.<!-- But can a socketed processor contain multiple NUMA nodes?  If so, this is the wrong place to look.  Also, how can you view the available memory for a NUMA Node? -->            </p>        </section>    </body></topic>
