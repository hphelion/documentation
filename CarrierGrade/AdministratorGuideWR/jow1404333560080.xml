    <title>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade 2.0 Alpha: Administrator Guide</title>


    <shortdesc >HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is a high-performance, high-availability,


        cloud operating system that enables telecommunications operators to use


        Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to manage Virtualized Network Functions (VNF)


        within a carrier grade Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture.</shortdesc>

        <p >HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade brings together the flexibility and scalability of the IT


            cloud, and the high-availability and performance demanded by the Telecommunications


            industry, into a unique carrier grade, industry-leading solution to deliver a


            price-performance ratio well above alternative solutions. HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is aligned


            with the ETSI-NFV architecture.</p>

            <p >HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade leverages core Wind River virtualization and


                carrier-grade technologies, Intel DPDK high-performance packet processing, open


                architectures, and the OpenStack software suite. It extends the OpenStack software


                suite to implement a unique carrier-grade, high-availability architecture, on which


                high-performance production systems can be deployed.</p>


            <p >Core capabilities unique to HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade include:</p>

                        <p >HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade provides significantly improved network


                            performance over the default open source OpenStack solution, up to 20

                        <p >At the center of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Networking is a

                            hosts. It provides connectivity between virtual machines on the same


                            compute node, and between virtual machines and external networks. AVS


                            supports a variety of network connectivity options with the hosted


                            virtual machines, as follows: </p>
