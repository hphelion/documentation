        <p >This chapter elaborates on software features available exclusively on the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade,
      which add to the already powerful set of management tools available from OpenStack. The
      exclusive features include virtual machine settings to optimize the use of virtual CPUs,
      improvements to the scheduling algorithms, better integration of NUMA architectures, and
      others.</p>
