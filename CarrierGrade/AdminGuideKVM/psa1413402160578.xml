    <title>PCI Passthrough Ethernet Interfaces</title>
    <shortdesc>A <term>passthrough</term> Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC on a
        compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. This minimizes packet
        processing delays but at the same time demands special operational
        considerations.</shortdesc>

            <p>For all purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were
                physically attached to the virtual machine. Therefore any potential throughput
                limitations coming from the virtualized environment, such as the ones introduced by
                internal copying of data buffers, are eliminated. However, by bypassing the
                virtualized environment, the use of PCI passthrough Ethernet devices introduces
                several restrictions that must be taken into consideration. They include:</p>
            <ul id="ul_mjs_m52_tp">
                <li>
                    <p>no support for LAG, QoS, ACL, or host interface monitoring</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>no support for live migration</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>no access to the compute node's AVS switch</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A passthrough interface bypasses the compute node's AVS switch
                completely, and is attached instead directly to the provider network's access
                switch. Therefore, proper routing of traffic to connect the passthrough interface to
                a particular tenant network depends entirely on the VLAN tagging options configured
                on both the passthrough interface and the access port on the switch.</p>
            <p>The access switch routes incoming traffic based on a VLAN ID, which ultimately
                determines the tenant network to which the traffic belongs. The VLAN ID is either
                explicit, as found in incoming tagged packets, or implicit, as defined by the access
                port's default VLAN ID when the incoming packets are untagged. In both cases the
                access switch must be configured to process the proper VLAN ID, which therefore has
                to be known in advance.</p>
            <p>To review the current PCI passthrough and SR-IOV device assignments
                for a given provider network, see <xref href="jow1439301559036.xml"/>.</p>
            <p>In the following example a new virtual machine is launched by user
                    <nameliteral>user1</nameliteral> on tenant <nameliteral>tenant1</nameliteral>, with a passthrough interface connected to
                the tenant network <nameliteral>net0</nameliteral> identified with
                VLAN ID 10.</p>

                <p>To use PCI passthrough or SR-IOV interfaces, you must have Intel
                    VT-d features enabled in the BIOS.</p>
            </note>
            <p>The exercise assumes that the underlying provider network
                    <nameliteral>group0-data0</nameliteral> exists already, and that VLAN ID 10 is a
                valid segmentation ID assigned to <nameliteral>tenant1</nameliteral>.</p>

                        Traffic across the connection is therefore untagged, and effectively
                        integrated into the targeted tenant network.</p>
                    <p>You can also use a trunk port on the access switch so that it
                        handles tagged packets as well. However, this opens the possibility for
                        guest applications to join other tenant networks using tagged packets with
                        different VLAN IDs, which might compromise the security of the system. See
