</section>
<section id="whatcommunity"> <title>What is HP Helion OpenStack(R) Community edition?</title>
<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) is a commercial-grade distribution of <xref href="http://www.openstack.org" scope="external" format="html" >OpenStack(R)</xref>, the leading open source cloud computing platform. This distribution, backed by HP, enables customers to more easily build, manage, and use open-source based hybrid clouds in a resilient, maintainable platform.</p>
<p>The HP Helion OpenStack(R) Community edition is a free-to-license distribution that speeds deployment and simplifies management of small-scale open cloud environments and infrastructure services. It supports up to 30 physical nodes and 600 virtual nodes making it ideal for small-scale, evaluation, and proof of concept deployments.</p>
<p>The Community edition enables customers to evaluate HP Helion OpenStack(R) build a better proof-of-concept, or deploy small-scale private clouds.</p>
<p>To expand to larger, enterprise-grade installations, upgrade to the <xref href="../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.index.dita" >full version</xref> of HP Helion OpenStack(R)</p>
</section>
<section id="distrocost"> <title>Is there a cost associated with this distribution?</title>
<p>It is free to download. Optional technical support packages are available to purchase from HP.</p>
</section>
<section id="hybridorpubliccloud"> <title>Will HP Helion OpenStack(R) Community edition work with hybrid or public cloud projects?</title>
<p>HP Helion OpenStack(R) Community edition is API-compatible with HP Helion Public Cloud, allowing workloads developed on one to be deployed on the other.  Compatibility with non-HP clouds will depend on which OpenStack(R) platform features they choose to support.</p>
</section>
<section id="TripleO"> <title>What is TripleO?</title>
<p>OpenStack(R)-on-OpenStack(R) or TripleO, is an official  OpenStack(R) project for deployment of OpenStack(R) systems. It builds on the core resource-provisioning strengths of OpenStack(R) technology. It enables you to administer your cloud or deploy and maintain virtual and baremetal installations of OpenStack(R) using the same APIs you are familiar with for deploying workloads on an OpenStack(R) cloud. A template-based deployment engine (using OpenStack(R) Heat) allows for rigorous testing and reliable, repeatable deployments of known configurations.</p>
<p>A TripleO installation includes a <xref type="section" href="#topic8233/whatisseed">seed</xref>, the <xref type="section" href="#topic8233/whatisundercloud">undercloud</xref> and the <xref type="section" href="#topic8233/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisseed"> <title>What is a seed?</title>
<p>A seed VM is a bootable KVM VM image provided as part of HP Helion OpenStack(R) and is deployed in a VM instance. This instance provisions physical hardware and deploys the undercloud. It also contains the minimum services required for OpenStack(R) to function: Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic &amp; Heat.</p>
<p>This is the first phase of the HP Helion OpenStack(R) installation.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisundercloud"> <title>What is the undercloud?</title>
<p>The undercloud server is a basic single-node OpenStack(R) installation running on a single physical server used to deploy, test, manage, and update the overcloud servers. There is no HA configuration for the undercloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud contains a strictly limited sub-set of services; just enough to interact with the overcloud. The services running on the undercloud are Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Ironic, Heat, Horizon &amp; Ceilometer. This server also contains the HP Helion content distribution catalog service, which provides a mechanism for downloading and installing content and updates for the overcloud.</p>
<p>The undercloud also hosts images for various server types which will form the functional cloud environment - the <xref type="section" href="#topic8233/whatisovercloud">overcloud</xref>. These images are overcloud Controller, overcloud Compute, overcloud Swift &amp; overcloud Compute Proxy (required for clouds that support VMWare ESX as a hypervisor).</p>
<p>Creating the undercloud is the second phase of the HP Helion installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="whatisovercloud"> <title>What is the overcloud?</title>
<p>The overcloud is the functional cloud available to run guest virtual machines and workloads. It offers access to the Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone, Cinder, Swift, Ironic, Heat, Horizon, and Ceilometer services.</p>
<p>Creating and configuring the overcloud completes the overall Helion OpenStack(R) installation process.</p>
</section>
<section id="specification"> <title>Specifications</title>
</section>
<section id="nodes"> <title>How many nodes does the Community edition support?</title>
<p>Up to 30 nodes with up to 600 virtual machines, subject to the size of the VMs and hardware capacity.</p>
</section>
<section id="softwareupdate"> <title>How can I update to the latest version?</title>
