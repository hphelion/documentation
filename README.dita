# HP Helion Public Cloud: Product and Service Documentation
This repository contains the documentation on using HP Helion Public Cloud product and services such as HP Helion Public Cloud Object Storage, the CLIs, and the language bindings. The content here is complimented by two other sources in the API documentation. The API documentation https://git.hpcloud.net/DevExDocs/apihome is separated because it is contributed by the services teams. When the full stack of documentation is generated (e.g., to produce a documentation site) both of these locations should be used.

 * http://devexbuild.infra.aw1.hpcloud.net/

## Jenkins

The Jenkins job to push the documentation can be found here:

http://devexbuild.infra.aw1.hpcloud.net:8080/view/docs/

There are several jobs in Jenkins and a jenkins directory of scripts to support those jobs.  It is best to look at Jenkins and the scripts to understand the jobs.
