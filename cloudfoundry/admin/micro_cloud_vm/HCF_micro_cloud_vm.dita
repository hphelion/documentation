  <p>By default, the <keyword keyref="prodShort"/> VM starts as a single-node micro cloud with a
   base set of roles already running and ready to use. You can use this VM to test pushing
   applications still in development. If your application deploys successfully to an <keyword
    keyref="prodShort"/> micro cloud, it will deploy to any <keyword keyref="prodShort"/> PaaS of
   the same version. The application hosting environment is the same in all aspects except
   scale.</p>
