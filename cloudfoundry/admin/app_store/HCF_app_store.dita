 <title>Working with the App Store</title>
 <shortdesc>The App Store is a collection of ready-to-run applications that can be deployed to
   <keyword keyref="prodShort"/> in a simple process. The interface uses the same API as the
   <keyword keyref="CLIfile"/> client, pulling the source code from a Git repository rather than
  pushing an archive from the user's local filesystem.</shortdesc>
