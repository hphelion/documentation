#     redirect-from redirect-to
#     Example:
#
#     path/from/root/to/old-file.html path/from/root/to/new-file.html
#
#     Note that the '#' symbol is not included.
#     This redirection method is a workaround that is needed because our helpset treats different pages
#     as anchors, and not as separate pages, so using mod rewrite and the .htaccess file will not work.
#     Keep this list of files as small as possible, because each line increases the time required to
#     click from one file to another.
