            <li class="li">You may not download and use patches, enhancements, bug fixes, or similar updates
              unless you have a license to the underlying Software. However, such license doesn't
              automatically give you a right to receive such updates and HPE reserves the right to
              make such updates only available to customers with support contracts.</li>

            <li class="li">You may not copy Software or make it available on a public or external distributed
              network.</li>

          </ul>
</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Remote Monitoring.</strong> Some software may require keys or other technical protection
          measures and HPE may monitor your compliance with the Agreement, remotely or otherwise. If
          HPE makes a license management program for recording and reporting license usage
          information, you will use such program no later than 180 days from the date it's made
          available.</li>

      <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Ownership.</strong> No transfer of ownership of any intellectual property will occur under

          Agreement states all remedies for warranty claims.</li>

        <li class="li">HPE does not warrant that the operation of software will be uninterrupted or error free,
          or that software will operate in hardware and software combinations other than as
          authorized by HPE in Supporting Material. To the extent permitted by law, HPE disclaims all
          other warranties.</li>
</ul>
</li>

      <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Intellectual Property Rights Infringement.</strong> HPE will defend and/or settle any claims
          against you that allege that HP-branded software as supplied under this Agreement
          infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. HPE will rely on your prompt
          notification of the claim and cooperation with our defense. HPE may modify the software so
          as to be non-infringing and materially equivalent, or we may procure a license. If these
          options are not available, we will refund to you the amount paid for the affected product
          in the first year or the depreciated value thereafter. HPE is not responsible for claims
          resulting from any unauthorized use of the software.</li>

        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Limitation of Liability.</strong>HP's liability to you under this Agreement is limited to
          the amount actually paid by you to HPE for the relevant software, except for amounts in
          Section 12 ("Intellectual Property Rights Infringement"). Neither you nor HPE will be
          liable for lost revenues or profits, downtime costs, loss or damage to data or indirect,
          special or consequential costs or damages. This provision does not limit either party's
          liability for: unauthorized use of intellectual property, death or bodily injury caused by
          their negligence; acts of fraud; willful repudiation of the Agreement; or any liability
          that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.</li>

      <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Termination.</strong> This Agreement is effective until terminated or in the case of a
          limited-term license, upon expiration; however, your rights under this Agreement terminate
          if you fail to comply with it. Immediately upon termination or expiration, you will
          destroy the software and documentation and any copies, or return them to HP. You may keep
          one copy of software and documentation for archival purposes. We may ask you to certify in
          writing you have complied with this section. Warranty disclaimers, the limitation of
          liability, this section on termination, and Section 15 ("General") will survive
          termination.</li>

          <strong class="ph b">General.</strong>
          <ol class="ol" type="a">

              of HPE payment of transfer fees and compliance with HP's software license transfer
              policies. Authorized assignments will terminate your license to the software and you
              must deliver software and documentation and copies thereof to the assignee. The
              assignee will agree in writing to this Agreement. You may only transfer firmware if
              you transfer associated hardware.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">U.S. Government</strong>. If the software is licensed to you for use in the

              obtaining any required export or import authorizations. You confirm that you are not
              located in a country that is subject to trade control sanctions (currently Cuba, Iran,
              N. Korea, N. Sudan, and Syria) and further agree that you will not retransfer the
              products to any such country. HPE may suspend its performance under this Agreement to
              the extent required by laws applicable to either party.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Audit</strong>. HPE may audit you for compliance with the software license terms. Upon
              reasonable notice, HPE may conduct an audit during normal business hours (with the
              auditor's costs being at HP's expense). If an audit reveals underpayments then you
              will pay to HPE such underpayments. If underpayments discovered exceed five (5)
              percent, you will reimburse HPE for the auditor costs.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Third Party and Open Source Components</strong>. To the extent the Supporting Material
              includes open source licenses, such licenses shall control over this Agreement with

              you send HPE written notice, HPE will send you a copy of the source code for a
              reasonable fee.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Notices</strong>. Written notices under this Agreement may be provided to HPE via the
              method provided in the Supporting Material or if none, via "contact HP" site on <a class="xref" href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank">www.hp.com</a>.</li>

              will not apply.</li>

            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Force Majeure</strong>. Neither party will be liable for performance delays nor for
              non-performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, except for payment

              respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous communication or agreements
              that may exist. Modifications to the Agreement will be made only through a written
              amendment signed by both parties. If HPE doesn't exercise its rights under this
              Agreement, such delay is not a waiver of its rights.</li>
