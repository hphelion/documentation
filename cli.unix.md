# UNIX CLI for HP Helion Public Cloud v13.5

___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life (EOL) Cycle process toward final deprecation. Please be aware that this does not mean that the UNIX CLI is "going away", but simply that HP Helion Public Cloud is relinquishing its ownership of this CLI and, instead, making it available on the [HPCloud Github](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli) repository. We want to encourage existing customers to eventually consider migrating to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs. As such, during this 6-month transition timeframe, HP Helion Public Cloud will be dedicating engineering efforts around the OpenStackClient CLI as the primary Unified CLI of choice for development around your OpenStack cloud services.

We wanted to ensure you were aware of the changes that may affect you during this 6-month transition time:

+ The UNIX CLI has moved to the HP Helion Public Cloud Github repository

  + In order to encourage development by the community, HP Helion Public Cloud is sharing it with the community as open source, hosted on [https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli). 
  + However, [links to 12.12 and 13.5 UNIX CLI downloads](#downloads), and all documentation, are still currently available on docs.hpcloud.com, as usual.
+ Bugs will be addressed

  + Although the CLI has moved into the open source community, showstoppers and significant defects will be examined and addressed by the HP Helion Public Cloud SDK/CLI team on a case-by-case basis.

HP Helion Public Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can get support, access the documentation, and download the source code [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).

_________________________________________

The UNIX CLI for HP Helion Public Cloud is a tool which allows Unix or Mac users to manage their HP Helion Public Cloud from the command line or automated through scripts.  There is no need to understand the underlying REST API or XML document format to use the CLI.  There are two versions of the CLI: the 2.0 version for HP Helion Public Cloud version 13.5 and the 1.9 version for HP Helion Public Cloud version 12.12. We recommend that you move to version v13.5, but during the transition you can still find the documentation for v12.12 here.
