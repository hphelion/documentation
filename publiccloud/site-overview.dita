# HP Helion Public Cloud Website Overview 

Welcome to the HP Helion Public Cloud website! We don't know about you, but whenever we go to a new site we're always thinking, "Yeah, okay; where the heck *is* everything?"  That's the question this page is designed to answer; it contains an overview of the site as a whole, as well as some details on other web pages on the site where you can get the information you need.  So ride along with us now:

##Quicklinks
Rather than force you to read this whole page to find the info you need, here are a few links that maybe can help you out quickly:

* [Site Map](/publiccloud/sitemap): This is a full map of all the documentation pages on the site.  Go here if you are looking for information on something specific, such as Ruby Fog Bindings, the Identity Service API, and other similar topics.
* [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base): A collection of searchable information about HP Helion Public Cloud. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Forums](https://community.hpcloud.com/): Where users get together and discuss issues with each other and some members of the HP Helion Public Cloud team. (This link is also in the navigation sidebar over on the right-hand side of every page.)
* [Console](https://horizon.hpcloud.com/): A link straight to the main HP Helion Public Cloud console.  Click on it and go!
* [Downloads](/publiccloud/downloads): A listing of all the downloads currently available for HP Helion Public Cloud.

<!--Add this back in at GA:
* [Release Notes](/release-notes): Overall release note information for the HP Helion Public Cloud software. -->

##Site Navigation
You may have already noticed that the site has multiple methods for navigating; we've included these so that you can choose the method that works best for you:

* The [Site Map](/publiccloud/sitemap) itself, as mentioned above, contains a full map of all the documentation pages on the website.
* Next to the HP Helion Public Cloud logo at the top of the page, there are three navigation pull-down menus and two quick links:
    - [**Products**](https://www.hpcloud.com/): Links to all the HP Helion Public Cloud products ([Compute](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/cloud-compute), [Object Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/object-storage), [CDN](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/CDN), [Block Storage](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/block-storage), [Relational Database](https://www.hpcloud.com/products/RDB), [Identity Service](https://www.hpcloud.com/content/hp-cloud-identity-service))
    - [**Documentation**](https://docs.hpcloud.com/publiccloud/overview): This here stuff you're currently reading; all the documentation available for the HP Helion Public Cloud software ([Compute](/publiccloud/compute), [Object Storage](/publiccloud/object-storage), [CDN](/publiccloud/cdn), [Block Storage](/publiccloud/block-storage), [Identity Service](/publiccloud/identity), [API](/publiccloud/api), [CLI](/publiccloud/cli), [Bindings](/publiccloud/bindings))
    - [**Community**](https://community.hpcloud.com/):  Links to HP Helion Public Cloud community resources ([Forum](https://community.hpcloud.com/forum), [Knowledge Base](https://community.hpcloud.com/knowledge-base), [System Status](https://community.hpcloud.com/status))
    - [**Blog**](http://h30529.www3.hp.com/t5/HP-Scaling-the-Cloud-Blog/bg-p/cloudBlog):  A link to our blog, where you can read contributions from a number of different members of the HP Helion Public Cloud team
    - [**Console**](https://horizon.hpcloud.com/):  A link directly to the HP Helion Public Cloud Console, so you can quickly access the HP Helion Public Cloud utilities
* On the right-hand side, you'll see a navigation panel that remains constant from page to page.  This panel contains links to the places we think you'll want to access most often:  the Site Map, the Knowledge Base, and the Forums.
* Also on the right-hand side, when you are on certain pages lower in the documentation hierarchy, a second navigation bar appears to provide you with quick access different levels in that particular hierarchy.  For example, when you surf to Bindings page, you can see a secondary navigation box that contains links to Overview page, and the two subordinate bindings pages on Ruby Fog and jclouds. Whatever page you are on is highlighted, to help you keep your place in the hierarchy.
