# HP Helion Public Cloud Networking Overview #

Leveraging [OpenStack Networking](http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-networking/), HP Helion Public Cloud Networking is a virtual networking service that provides network connectivity and addressing for HP Helion Public Cloud compute devices. 

In the 13.5 release, HP Helion Public Cloud compute and networking services are separate entities, integrating services and providing new features.

You can now define and configure your own virtual network topology, including control of IP address ranges.
