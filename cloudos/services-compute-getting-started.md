# Getting Started with HP Cloud OS Compute Service #

<!-- modeled after HP Cloud Networking Getting Started (network.getting.started.md) -->

Leveraging OpenStack Compute, HP Cloud compute provides a way to instantiate virtual servers on publicly accessible physical machines hosted in HP data centers. Key terms include:

- Flavor - A unique combination of disk space, memory capacity, and CPU
- Image - A collection of files used as a base installation, typically an operating system such as Ubuntu 10.10 or something similar.
- Server - An instance created out of a Flavor + an Image

A variety of flavors and images are provided by HP Cloud compute that can be used to create a wide mix of servers.
