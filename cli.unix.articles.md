# UNIX CLI for HP Helion Public Cloud: Articles on to use the UNIX CLI v12.12
___________________

###Important Notice###

On November 4, 2013, the UNIX CLI was moved into its End-of-Life Cycle process toward final deprecation. During this 6-month transition time:

* New and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the OpenStackClient (Unified) CLIs or the OpenStack command-line clients for each respective service
* No new feature requests will be honored
* Bug reports will be accepted

HP Helion Public Cloud has contributed the Unix CLI back to the open source community, and you can get support, access the documentation, and download the source code [here](https://github.com/hpcloud/unix_cli).
