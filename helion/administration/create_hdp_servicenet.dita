  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Creating the HP Helion Development Platform Service Net</title>
  <body>
    <section>Many of the HP Helion Developer Platform services require the creation of a VM service
      network in order to access the cloud control plane. This service network is a
      VLAN-encapsulated provider network which is fully routable to the HP Helion OpenStack MGMT
      network. <note type="important">Create this network before attempting to install the HP Helion
        Developer Platform. </note><ol>
        <li>SSH to the deployer/lifecycle-manager node using admin credentials.</li>
        <li>Source the admin credentials: <codeblock>source ~/service.osrc</codeblock></li>
        <li>Configure a Neutron network that will map to an external network for the service net. <ul>
            <li>For simple configurations, a lifecycle-manager playbook has been provided for this purpose.</li>
            <li>For non-trivial network configurations, any additional routes should be added to
              the subnet definition using the <codeph>--host-route</codeph> option of the neutron
              subnet-create command. The <codeph>--host-route</codeph> option can be specified
              multiple times if necessary.
              <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts neutron-svc-net-configure.yml \
    -e PROV_NET_TYPE=&#60;provider_network_type&#62; \
    -e PROV_PHYS_NET=&#60;physical_network_name&#62; \
    -e PROV_NET_VLAN_ID=&#60;vlan_id&#62; \
    -e SVC_NET_CIDR=&#60;provider_network_cidr&#62; \
    -e SVC_NET_DEST=&#60;svc_net_destination&#62; \
    -e SVC_NET_GATEWAY="gateway_used_by_the_network"           </codeblock>Example:
              Given a management network with the following attributes: <sl>
                <sli>MGMT Net = 192.168.245.1/32</sli>
                <sli>SVC Net = 10.55.66.0/24</sli>
                <sli>SVC gateway to MGMT = 10.55.66.3</sli>
                <sli>SVC Net VLAN = 100</sli>
              </sl> the playbook command for creating the service network would be:
              <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts neutron-svc-net-configure.yml -e PROV_NET_TYPE=vlan -e PROV_PHYS_NET=physnet1 -e PROV_NET_VLAN_ID=100 -e SVC_NET_CIDR=10.55.66.0/24 -e SVC_NET_DEST=192.168.245.1/32 -e SVC_NET_GATEWAY=10.55.66.3</codeblock></li>
          </ul><note>To configure a service network for flat encapsulation, modify the service
            network creation statement: <codeph>-e PROV_NET_TYPE flat</codeph> The subnet creation
            statement does not change.</note></li><li>Configure your <codeph>my_cloud </codeph>definition to include the service network. This is used
          to provide routing from management (and potentially other networks) back to the newly
          created service net. <ol>
            <li>Ensure that the service network is routable from the management network and that the
              service network is defined in
                <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/network_groups.yml</codeph>:
              <codeblock># Management 
# 
# This is the network group that will be used for 
# management traffic within the cloud. 
# 
# The interface used by this group will be presented 
# to Neutron as physnet1, and used by provider VLANS 
# 
# In this example this group is also used for ISCSI 
# traffic between VMs and the VSA block storage

  # removed items 
# Service 
# 
# This is the network group that will be used for in-cloud 
# service traffic to control plane 
# 
- name: SERVICE</codeblock></li>
            <li>Ensure that there is a valid definition for the service network in
                <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/networks.yml</codeph>
              <note>The <codeph>cidr</codeph> and <codeph>gateway</codeph> given must match the
                values provided when the network was
              created.</note><codeblock>- name: SERVICE-NET

            <li>Ensure that this network is a member of the server-group listed in

            <li>Once these changes have been made, the normal mechanisms should be used
              (configuration-processor-run.yml, ready-deployment.yml, site.yml) to push this change
