  <title>Examine Details of Planned Ring Changes Prior to Deploy</title>
  <body>
    <!--You must run the <codeph>_swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeph> playbook as mentioned in step <b>1</b> in <b> </b><xref href="../installation.dita#topic_flx_j2b_ws/validate_swift">Validate Object Storage</xref> otherwise the files needed to run the <codeph>swiftlm-ring-supervisor</codeph> will not be in place on the node. -->
    <p>Before running the <codeph>site.yml</codeph> playbook ( refer <xref
        href="../bare_installation_kvm.dita#install_kvm/run-config-processor" type="section"/>), you
      can see the planned layout of Swift rings using the following steps:</p>
    <section>
      <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>
      <p><?oxy_custom_end?><ul id="ul_sqc_r2b_kt">
          <li>Log onto the first node in the system that is running the swift-proxy-server
            process.</li>
          <li>Execute the following command to get the entire list drives and the actions planned
            for the rings by executing the following
            command:<codeblock>sudo swiftlm-ring-supervisor --make-delta --report --detail detail</codeblock></li>
        </ul> The output is verbose. Redirect the output to a file so that it is easier to
          examine.<ul id="ul_erc_r2b_kt">
          <li>Validate the following in the output:<ul id="ul_orc_r2b_kt">
              <li>Drives are being added to all rings in the ring specifications.</li>
              <li>Servers are being used as expected (for example, you may have a different set of
                servers for the account/container rings than the object rings.)</li>
              <li>The weight value is as expected. The weight value is the drive size expressed in
                GB (i.e., a 1 TB drive has a weight of 1024).</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul></p>
