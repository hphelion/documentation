  <title>Overview of the Cloud Model : entry-scale-with-vsa </title>

    <p>This page describes the configuration of Swift services with the various types of input
      models supported in this release. </p>
    <section><title>Types of Input Model(s)</title>
      <ul><li><b>
            <xref href="#modify-input-model/entry-scale-with-vsa" format="dita"
              >entry-scale-with-vsa</xref></b>: This has a single control plane cluster which runs
          all services (Nova, Swift, Glance, etc) with an additional 3 resource nodes used as Nova
          compute servers.
            <p><!--<b><xref href="#topic_qkg_l4v_bt/mid-size" format="dita">mid size cloud</xref> </b>: This example cloud model describes a system using multiple servers and networks. It provides an example for the configuration of the mid sized cloud. --></p></li></ul></section>
    <section id="entry-scale-with-vsa"><title>Entry-scale-with-vsa</title><p>The
          <codeph>entry-scale-with-vsa</codeph> input model is relatively simple and constrained.
        You must ensure that the disk drives exists and are correctly assigned to Swift nodes.
        Therefore, no Swift-specific modification is required for this model while deploying
        Swift.</p><p>Before starting the deployment, you must validate, and possibly update the data
        in the example cloud model files as follows:<ul>
          <li>Examine the <codeph>data/disks_controller.yml</codeph> file and validate that the
            drives exist and have the appropriate preconditions as described in <xref
              href="allocating_disk_drives.dita#allocating-disk-drives/requirement-disk-device"
              >Requirements for a disk device</xref>.</li>
          <li> If you plan to add more Swift storage nodes or drives, you should read the
            information about partition power in <xref
              href="ring_specifications.dita#topic_efw_k55_dt">Specifying the rings (ring
              specifications)</xref>. However, in most cases you do not need to change the
              <codeph>config/swift/rings.yml</codeph> file.</li>
        </ul></p><sectiondiv><b>Node Type</b></sectiondiv><p><b>Proxy, Container, Account, Object
          (PACO) Node</b>: The Swift-proxy, Account, Container and Object services run on the same
        (PACO) node type in the control plane. All other control services also run in this node
        type.
        <!--This is used for smaller clouds or where Swift is a minor element in a larger cloud.--></p><sectiondiv><b>YML
          files associated with Swift Services</b></sectiondiv><p>The following <codeph>yml</codeph>
        files are configured for <b>entry-scale-with-vsa</b> model:</p><simpletable

      <p><!--The Swift-proxy service uses two other cloud services. Both of these are configured in the example to run on the <b>core</b> cluster: <ul id="ul_iyr_gps_ht"><li>Swift validates tokens by making requests to the Keystone service</li><li>Swift caches tokens and other data using the memcached service</li></ul>--></p>
