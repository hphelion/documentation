    <section id="about">
      <p>The Operations Console (Ops Console) for <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> is designed for
          <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> Administrators to have a web-based UI they can use to view data
        about their cloud infrastructure. The Ops Console is a web-based GUI that offers the user
        access to data such as monitoring alarms data by service, performance data, compute nodes
        and instances lists, and a drilldown to Kibana for a deep look into logs. The Business Logic
        Layer is a middleware component that serves as a single point of contact for the UI to
        communicate with OpenStack services such as Monasca, Nova, and others.</p>

      <p>If your administrator set a hostname value for <codeph>external_name</codeph> in your
          <codeph>network_groups.yml</codeph> file during the configuration process for your cloud
        then the Operations Console will be accessed over port 9095 on that hostname.</p>
      <p>If your administrator did not set a hostname value then in order to determine which IP
        address to use to access Horizon you can use this command from your lifecycle manager:
        <codeblock>grep vip-HZN-WEB /etc/hosts</codeblock></p>
      <p>The output of that command will show you the virtual IP address you should use. It is
        listening over port 9095 on that virtual IP address, so you can use the following syntax to
        access it:<codeblock>http://VIP:9095</codeblock></p>
      <p>The default username for the Administrator user is <codeph>admin</codeph>. In order to find
        the randomized password that is created for this user you will need to look into the
          <codeph>~/service.osrc</codeph> file on the lifecycle manager. You can do that with this
        command:</p>
      <codeblock>cat ~/service.osrc</codeblock>
