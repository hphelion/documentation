    <section id="creds"><title>Determining Your User Credentials</title>
      <p>On your lifecycle-manager node, in the
          <codeph>~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible/group_vars/</codeph> directory you will find
        several files. In the one labeled as first control plane node you can locate the user
        credentials for both the Administrator user (<codeph>admin</codeph>) and your Demo user
          (<codeph>demo</codeph>) which you will use to perform many other actions on your
        cloud.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are using the Entry-scale KVM with VSA model and used the default
        naming scheme given in the example configuration files, you can use these commands on your
        lifecycle-manager node to GREP for your user credentials:</p>
      <p><b>Administrator</b></p>
      <codeblock>grep keystone_admin_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</codeblock>
      <p><b>Demo</b></p>
      <codeblock>grep keystone_demo_pwd entry-scale-kvm-vsa-control-plane-1</codeblock>
    </section>
    <section id="env_vars"><title>Setup Environment Variables</title>
      <p>This playbook will setup the proper environmental variables for your cloud so you can use
        command-line clients</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Run the following command, which will replace <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> on the
            deployer:</p>
          <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts cloud-client-setup.yml</codeblock>
          <p>As the <codeph>/etc/hosts</codeph> file no longer has entries for Helion lifecycle
            management, sudo commands may become a bit slower. To fix this issue, once this step is
            complete, add "hlm" after "127.0.0.1 localhost". The result will look like this:</p>
          <codeblock>...
# Localhost Information
127.0.0.1 localhost hlm</codeblock></li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="sshkeys"><title>Backup Your SSH Keys</title>
      <p>As part of the cloud deployment setup process, SSH keys to access the systems are generated
        and stored in <codeph>~/.ssh</codeph> on your deployer/lifecycle-manager node.</p>
      <p>These SSH keys allow access to the subsequently deployed systems and should be included in
        the list of content to be archived in any backup strategy.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="endpoints"><title>Retrieving Service Endpoints</title>
      <!--  TODO add some content here  <p>text</p>-->
      <ol>
        <li><p>From your deployer/lifecycle-manager node, source the admin creds setup during the
            installation:</p>
          <p><codeblock>unset OS_TENANT_NAME
source ~/keystone.osrc</codeblock></p></li>
        <li><p>Using the OpenStack command-line tool you can then query the Keystone service for
            your endpoints:</p>
          <p><codeblock>openstack endpoint list</codeblock></p>
          <note type="tip">You can use <codeph>openstack -h</codeph> to access the client help file
            and a full list of commands.</note></li>
      </ol>
