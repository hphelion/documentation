    <section><title>Disable backup/restore jobs creation completely:</title>
      <p>To disable Freezer's deployment, comment out the following lines in the following files:
          <note>This action is required even if you already removed Freezer lines from your model
          (control_plane.yml).</note></p>
      <p>In hlm-deploy.ym:<codeblock># - include: freezer-deploy.yml</codeblock></p>

    <section><title>Disable backup/restore jobs creation completely:</title><p>It is possible to
        continue deploying Freezer and prevent the lifecycle manager from creating automatic backup
        jobs.</p><p>By default, the lifecycle manager deployment automatically creates jobs for the
        backup and restore of the following:<ul>
          <li>Deployer/Lifecycle-manager node</li>
          <li>MySQL database</li>
          <li>Swift rings</li>
        </ul></p>You can disable the creation of those jobs while launching the deployment process,
      as
        follows:<codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts site.yml -e '{ "freezer_backup_jobs_upload": false }' -e '{ "freezer_restore_jobs_upload": false }'</codeblock><p>When
        using those options, the Freezer infrastructure will still be deployed but will not execute
        any backups.</p></section>
    <section><title>Disable the backup/restore jobs of a specific service:</title>
      <p>If some fine tuning is required, you can edit the following file before running the
        Configuration Processor and ready deployment scripts:
        <codeblock>~/helion/hos/ansible/_freezer_manage_jobs.yml</codeblock></p>
      <p>You can combine the following instructions to disable the creation of multiple service
        jobs. <ul>
          <li>To disable the deployer's jobs, comment-out all localhost paragraphs, as follows:
