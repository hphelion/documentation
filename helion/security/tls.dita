      <p outputclass="aTest">The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, successor to SSL, provides
        the mechanisms to ensure authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality, and integrity of
        user communications to the <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> services from public endpoints.</p>
      <p>OpenStack endpoints are HTTP (REST) services providing APIs to other OpenStack services on
        the management network. All traffic to OpenStack services coming in on the public endpoints
        are secured using TLS connections.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="notes"><title>Notes</title>
      <p>All of the <keyword keyref="kw-hos-phrase"/> example cloud models ship with TLS enabled on
        the public API endpoints. Because TLS is enabled by default, a test certificate is bundled
        with the release. Having this default cert allows you to bring up a cloud without having to
        worry about certificates. It will not match the IP address of your environments API
        endpoints, but you can ignore the warnings. Later, when you require a trusted certificate,
        you can add your own certificate and redeploy using the instructions below.</p>
      <p>Keystone currently doesn't support updating an endpoint. Therefore <b>the public endpoint
          cannot be changed after the initial deployment</b>. This has the following
        implications:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>TLS cannot be turned on/off after the initial deployment</li>
        <li>The public endpoint IP address or FQDN cannot be changed after deployment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Therefore, you will have to make one of the following choices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comment out the "external-name:" line in
            <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/network_groups.yml</codeph> (so that IP
          addresses are used) </li>
        <li>Assign a name to the "external-name:" line in
            <codeph>~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data/network_groups.yml</codeph> (so that an FQDN
          is used) </li>
      </ul> You also need to choose if you want TLS on or off. We recommend keeping TLS on by
      default as it cannot be changed. But if you want it disabled you need to change
      "tls-components" to "components" in <codeph>network_groups.yml</codeph> and comment out the
      cert-file. </section>

      <title>Creating a Self-Signed Certificate</title>
      <p>If you want to install a self-signed certificate for testing purposes that meets the needs
        of <keyword keyref="kw-hos"/> and HPE Helion Development Platform, follow these steps to
        create the cert, and then install it by following the installation in the next section.</p>
      <note type="important">Self-signed certificates should not be used in a production
        environment, they are meant for testing only.</note>
      <p>The domain name in the certificate signing request in step 1 below and the DNS entry in
        step 2 must match, although the domain does not have to exist.</p>
      <p>In step 2 you need the same IP address listed for both the DNS and the IP entries. The IP
        address is what is used by HPE Helion Development Platform and the DNS is used by <keyword
          keyref="kw-hos"/>. Note that as you examine the certificate output, the issuer will match
        the subject because the cert is self-signed. The requirement for the DNS entry stems from a
        low-level Python bug.</p>
      <p>The example below shows you how to create a self-signed certificate named
          <codeph>my-public-cert</codeph>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with a defined subject:
          <codeblock>openssl req -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout my-public-cert.key -out my-public-cert.csr -text \
-subj '/C=US/O=Helion Test Certificate/CN=your.domain.com/emailAddress=test@ficticious.org/'</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Create a file containing v3 extensions Ensure that the DNS entry matches any CN entry
          above and provide your IP
          <codeblock>cat > v3_ext.cnf &lt;&lt; *EOF*
[ v3_req ]
subjectAltName=DNS:your.domain.com,DNS:10.0.0.1, IP:10.0.0.1
*EOF*</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li>Self-sign your certificate
          <codeblock>openssl x509 -extfile v3_ext.cnf -extensions v3_req -in my-public-cert.csr -signkey my-public-cert.key -req -text -out my-public-cert.crt</codeblock>

    <section><title><codeph>Accessing public endpoints from a machine other than the machine hosting the virtual
      cloud</codeph></title>Start by repeating what was done for the machine hosting the virtual cloud. But this
      time your /etc/hosts entry for myhelion.test should point to the IP address of the host
      running the virtual cloud. After this you need to have something tunnelling the packets to the
      VIP. This is easily accomplished with haproxy in tunnel mode. (mode tcp). But you need to have
      a stanza for every open port. But the stanzas are quite generic and can be scripted. For
      example if I want to do 'nova list' I may need port 5000 (keystone) and port 8774 (nova-api),
        <ol id="ol_ofb_djg_rt">
        <li>Install haproxy with apt-get </li>
        <li>Open<codeph> /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</codeph> and append the following sections to the existing
          content:
          <codeblock>listen keystone-5000
      option ssl-hello-chk
      mode tcp
      bind 16.25.10.10:5000
      server keystone-5000 192.168.245.10:5000 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
      listen nova-8774
      option ssl-hello-chk
      mode tcp
      bind 16.25.10.10:8774
      server nova-8774 192.168.245.10:8774 check inter 2000 rise 2 fall 5
      
      16.25.10.10 is the host running the virtual cloud
      192.168.254.10 is the VIP</codeblock></li>
      </ol> One way to generate the list of all public ports behind TLS is to run 'grep "ssl crt"
      /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg' from a controller. </section>-->
