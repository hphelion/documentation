  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Applying Input Model Changes to Existing
    Rings</title>
  <body>
    <p>This section describes a general approach for making changes to the existing rings. This
      approach applies to actions such as adding and removing a server and replacing and upgrading
      disk drives, and must be performed as a series of phases, as shown below:</p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_sqz_jft_4t">
        <li><b>Changing the Input Model Phase</b><p>Do the following:<ol id="ol_jv2_zf5_pt">
              <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute. (For instructions, see <xref
                  href="setting_up_weight_attributes_ring_changes.dita#topic_t1y_vjs_4t"/>). </li>
              <li>Edit the Input Model as appropriate. You must edit the YAML file as per your
                requirement. (For more information, see <xref href="../input_model.dita#input_model"
                /></li>
              <li>Commit your configuration to the local Git repository. (For more information,
                  see<xref href="../installation/using_git.dita#using_git"/>.)
                :<codeblock>git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the configuration
                processor:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Create a deployment
                directory:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Validate that the number of drives proposed to be added or deleted, or the weight
                change, is correct. Fix any errors in your input model. At this stage, no changes
                have been made to rings. </li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>First phase of Ring Rebalance:</b><p>Do the following:<ol id="ol_f5m_dg5_pt">
              <li>Apply the input model changes to the rings, rebalance the rings, and then deploy
                them to all Swift nodes by running the
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-deploy.yml </codeblock></li>
              <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> has elapsed
                (whichever is longer). For more information, see <xref
                  href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>Weight Change Phase of Ring Rebalance:</b><p>At this stage, no changes have been made
            to the input model. However, when you set the <codeph>weight-step</codeph> attribute,
            the rings that were rebuilt in the previous rebalance phase have weights that are
            different than their target/final value. You gradually move to the target/final weight
            by rebalancing a number of times as described in this page. For more information about
            the weight-step attribute, see <xref
              href="setting_up_weight_attributes_ring_changes.dita#topic_t1y_vjs_4t"/>.</p><p>Do the
              following:<ol id="ol_vyc_gg5_pt">
              <li>Rebalance the rings by running the
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Run the
                reconfiguration:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-reconfigure.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> has elapsed
                (whichever is longer). For more information, see <xref
                  href="safe_rebalance_deploy_ring.dita#topic_ohx_j1t_4t"/></li>
              <li>Run the following command and review the
                  report:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeblock><p>The
                  following is an example of the output after executing the above command. In the
                  example <b>no</b> weight changes are
                  proposed:<codeblock>TASK: [swiftlm-ring-supervisor | validate-input-model | Print report] ********* 
ok: [padawan-ccp-c1-m1-mgmt] => {
    "var": {
        "report.stdout_lines": [
            "Need to add 0 devices", 
            "Need to remove 0 devices", 
            "<b>Need to set weight on 0 devices</b>"
        ]
    }
}</codeblock></p></li>
              <li>When there are no proposed weight changes, you proceed to the final phase.</li>
              <li>If there are proposed weight changes repeat this phase again. </li>
            </ol></p></li>
        <li><b>Final Rebalance Phase:</b><p>The final rebalance phase moves all replicas to their
            final destination.<ol id="ol_nlx_3g5_pt">
              <li>Rebalance the rings by running the playbook:
                  <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible/
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost _swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml | tee /tmp/rebalance.log</codeblock><note>The
                  output is saved for later reference.</note></li>
              <li>Review the output from the previous step. If the output for all rings is similar
                to the following, the rebalance had no effect. That is, the rings are balanced and
                no further changes are needed. In addition, the ring files were not changed so you
                do not need to deploy them to the Swift
                  nodes:<codeblock>"Running: swift-ring-builder /etc/swiftlm/builder_dir/region-region1/account.builder rebalance 999", 
      "NOTE: No partitions could be reassigned.", 
      "Either none need to be or none can be due to min_part_hours [16]."</codeblock><p>The
                  text <b>No partitions could be reassigned</b> indicates that no further rebalances
                  are necessary. If this is true for all the rings, you have completed the final
                    phase.<note>You must have allowed enough time to elapse since the last
                    rebalance. As mentioned in the above example, <codeph>min_part_hours
                      [16]</codeph> means that you must wait at least 16 hours since the last
                    rebalance. If not, you should wait until enough time has elapsed and repeat this
                    phase.</note></p></li>
              <li>Run the <codeph>swift-reconfigure.yml</codeph>
                playbook:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts swift-reconfigure.yml</codeblock></li>
              <li>Wait until replication has finished or <codeph>min-part-time</codeph> has elapsed
                (whichever is longer). For more information see <xref

              <li>Repeat the above steps until the ring is rebalanced.</li>

            <stentry><p>When a drive fails, replace it as soon as possible. Do not attempt to remove
                it from the ring – this creates operator overhead. Swift will continue to store the
                correct number of replicas by handing off objects to other drives instead of the
                failed drive.</p>If the disk drives are of the same size as the original when the
              drive is replaced, no ring changes are required. You can confirm this by running the
                <codeph>_swift-make-delta-rebalance.yml</codeph> playbook. It should report that no
              weight changes are needed. <p>For a single drive replacement, even if the drive is
                significantly larger than the original drives, you do not need to rebalance the ring
                (however, the extra space on the drive will not be used).</p></stentry>

            <stentry>Upgrading Disk Drives</stentry>
            <stentry>
              <p>If the drives are different size (for example, you are upgrading your system), you
                can proceed as follows:</p>
              <ul id="ul_smv_pfz_4t">
                <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute</li>
                <li>Replace drives in phases:<ul id="ul_gvy_5fz_4t">
                    <li>Avoid replacing too many drives at once.</li>
                    <li>If your rings use swift zones, upgrade a number of drives in the same zone
                      at the same time – not drives in several zones.</li>
                    <li>It is also safer to upgrade one server instead of drives in several servers
                      at the same time.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the final size of all Swift zones must be the same, so you may
                      need to replace a small number of drives in one zone, then a small number in
                      second zone, then return to the first zone and replace more drives, etc. </li>
