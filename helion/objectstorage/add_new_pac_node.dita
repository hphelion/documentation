  <title>HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Adding a Proxy, Account, Container (PAC)
    Node</title>
  <body>
    <p>This topic describes how to add new nodes/Swift proxy, account, and container (PAC) server to
      an existing system.</p>
    <section>
      <title>To add a new node</title>
      <p>To add a new node to your cloud, you will need to add it to <codeph>servers.yml</codeph>,
        and then run the scripts that update your cloud configuration. To begin, access the
          <codeph>servers.yml file</codeph> by checking out the Git branch where you are required to
        make the changes:
        <!--You must add a new node details in the <codeph>server.yml</codeph> file. --></p>
      <p>Then, perform the following steps to add a new node:<ol id="ol_p4w_gbr_4t">
          <li><!--Log in to the deployer node.-->Get the <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file stored in
            Git:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/my_cloud/definition/data
git checkout site</codeblock></li>
          <li>If not already done, set the weight-step attribute. For instructions, see <xref
              href="setting_up_weight_attributes_ring_changes.dita#topic_t1y_vjs_4t"/>.</li>
          <li>Add details of new nodes to the <codeph>servers.yml</codeph>
              file:<codeblock>servers:
...
- id: swpac4 
  role: SWPAC-ROLE
  server-group: &lt;server-group-name>
  mac-addr: &lt;mac-address>
  nic-mapping: &lt;nic-mapping-name>
  ip-addr: &lt;ip-address>
  ilo-ip: &lt;ilo-ip-address>
  ilo-user: &lt;ilo-username> 
  ilo-password: &lt;ilo-password></codeblock><p>
              In the above example, only one new server <b>swpac6 </b> is added. However, you can
              add multiple servers by providing the server details in the
                <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file.</p></li>
          <!--In the entry-scale configurations, there is no Swift PAC cluster. If your system does not have a Swift PAC cluster, you need to add it to the input model as explained in <xref href="creating_pac_cluster.dita#topic_rvj_21c_jt"/>-->
          <li>In the entry-scale configurations, there is no <b>dedicated</b> Swift PAC cluster.
            Instead, there is a cluster using servers that have a role of CONTROLLER-ROLE. You
            cannot add <b>swpac4</b> to this cluster because that would change the member count. If
            your system does not already have a dedicated Swift PAC cluster, you need to add it to
            the input model. (For instructions, see <xref
              href="creating_pac_cluster.dita#topic_rvj_21c_jt"/>.) The following steps assume that
            you have already created a dedicated Swift PAC cluster and
            that<?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="140,255,140"?> it has two
            members (<b>swpac4</b> and
              <b>swpac5</b>)<?oxy_custom_end?>.<!--<p>In the entry-scale configurations, the Swift PAC servers are co-located with other services on the first control plane cluster. If you want to extend the Swift PAC servers, i.e, more than 3 Swift PAC, then you need to add dedicated servers for the Swift PAC service. You have an option to leave the first 3 Swift PAC servers on the first control plane cluster and add a new dedicated Swift PAC server; or you can have all the Swift PAC servers on the dedicated servers.</p><p>If you want to move the Swift PAC services from the first control plane cluster onto dedicated servers then remove all Swift services from the first control plane cluster. For example remove the following services from the first control plane cluster in <codeph>data/control_plane.yml</codeph>:</p>--><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="153,255,255"?><p><?oxy_custom_end?><!--  <codeblock>- swift-ring-builder
- swift-proxy
- swift-account
- swift-container
- swift-client</codeblock>--></p></li>
          <li>Increase the member count of the Swift PAC cluster, as appropriate. For example, if
            you are adding <b>swpac6</b> and you previously had two Swift PAC nodes, the increased
            member count should be 3 as shown in the following example:<p>
              <codeblock>control-planes:
    - name: control-plane-1
      control-plane-prefix: cp1

  . . .
  clusters:
  . . .
     - name: ....
       cluster-prefix: c2
       server-role: SWPAC-ROLE
       member-count: 3
   . . .
       <!--allocation-policy: strict
       service-components:
         - ntp-client
         - swift-ring-builder
         - swift-proxy
         - swift-account
         - swift-container
         - swift-client--></codeblock>
            </p></li>
          <li>Commit your
              changes:<codeblock>git add -A
git commit -m "Add Node &lt;name>"</codeblock><note>Before
              you run any playbooks, remember that you need to export the encryption key in the
              following environment variable: <codeph>export
                HOS_USER_PASSWORD_ENCRYPT_KEY=&lt;encryption key></codeph>. For instructions, see
                <xref href="../installation/install_entryscale_swift.dita#install_swift"
            />.</note></li>
          <li>Run the configuration
            processor:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock></li>
          <li>Create a deployment
            directory:<codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock></li>
          <li>Configure Cobbler to include the new node and reimage the node (if you are adding
            several nodes, use a comma-separated list for the <codeph>nodelist</codeph>
              argument):<codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost cobbler-deploy.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-reimage.yml -e nodelist=&lt;server-id></codeblock><p>In
              the following example, the server id is <b>swpac6</b> (mentioned in step
              3):<codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost cobbler-deploy.yml
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost bm-reimage.yml -e nodelist=swpac6</codeblock></p><note>You
              must use the server id as it appears in the <codeph>servers.yml</codeph> file in the
              field &lt;server-id>.</note></li>
          <li>Review the <codeph>cloudConfig.yml</codeph> and
              <codeph>data/control_plane.yml</codeph> files to get the host prefix (for example,
            helion) and the control plane name (for example, cp1). This gives you the hostname of
            the node. Configure the operating
              system:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml --limit &lt;hostname></codeblock><p>For
              example, for <b>swpac6</b>, the hostname is
              <b>helion-cp1-c2-m3-mgmt</b>:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts osconfig-run.yml --limit helion-cp1-c2-m3-mgmt</codeblock></p></li>
          <li>Validate that the disk drives of the new node are compatible with the disk model used
            by the
            node:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts _swift-validate-input-model.yml</codeblock>If
            any errors occur, correct them. For instructions, see <xref
              href="interpreting_swift_validate_input_model.dita#topic_avw_22b_kt"/>.</li>
          <li>Run the <codeph>hlm-deploy.yml</codeph> playbook to rebalance the rings to include the
            node, deploy the rings, and configure the new node. Do not limit this to just the node
              (<b>swpac6</b>) that you are
            adding:<codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-deploy.yml </codeblock></li>
          <li>You may need to perform further rebalances of the rings. For instructions, see the
            "Weight Change Phase of Ring Rebalance" and the "Final Rebalance Phase" sections of
              <xref href="input_model_change_existing_rings.dita#topic_vyp_cft_4t"
              />.<p><!--Once you have added a new node/server to the system, you must enure that the Swift rings are updated with the new node/server(s) details and the rings are distributed to all Swift servers.--></p></li>
