# HP Helion OpenStack&#174;: Logging into the Helion Dashboards

1. Ask the cloud operator for the host name or public IP address where the dashboard is located, your user name, and your password.

2. Open a web browser that has both JavaScript and cookies enabled.

3. In the address bar, enter the host name or IP address for the dashboard.

	**Note:** If a certificate warning appears when you try to access the URL for the first time, a self-signed certificate is in use. These certificates are not considered trustworthy by default. Verify the certificate or add an exception in the browser to bypass the warning.

4. On the **Log In** page, enter your user name and password and then click **Sign In**.

5. If you are a non-admin user, you will only be able to select a project from the list at the top of the screen.
