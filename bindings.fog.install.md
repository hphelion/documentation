# HP Cloud Ruby Fog Binding Installation

##Important Notice##

Over the past two years, we have been a leading contributor of the Ruby Fog binding and have contributed to features that span Folsom to Havana. On November 4, 2013, the HP Public Cloud extensions for Ruby Fog Bindings became a part of the standard Fog download available from the main [Fog repository](https://github.com/fog/fog).  This 'hpfog' gem contribution means you no longer need a special download to work with our cloud. All of our current [documentation](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/master/lib/fog/hp/README.md) has been transitioned to the Ruby Fog community and is available in the Fog GitHub repository.
 
The Ruby Fog community has hundreds of [active contributors](https://github.com/fog/fog/graphs/contributors) and we are looking forward to further enhancements and features generated from this healthy and collaborative community.

Read our [blog post](http://www.hpcloud.com/blog/releasing-ruby-bindings-wild) to learn more about our work with Ruby Fog.

Visit the Fog site for the following installation information and documentation:
