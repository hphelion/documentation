<p>The HP Helion Development Platform currently contains four components: Application Lifecycle Service (ALS), Marketplace Service, Messaging Service and Database Service.</p>

<p>The following topics explain how to install and configure the HP Helion Development Platform. There is also <xref href="1.2/1.2devplatform.troubleshooting.dita">Troubleshooting</xref> documentation to handle issues that may occur.

<section id="prerequisites"> <title>Prerequisites</title>

	<p>The HP Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HP Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm>.</p> 

	<p>Before you begin installation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You must log in to the system where you intend to run the installation script as the *root* user.</li>

	<li>The Cinder block storage service must be configured with either [VSA](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/vsa/overview/) or [3Par](/helion/openstack/1.1/install/3par/).</li>
 
	<li>If you installed HP Helion OpenStack with <b>KVM</b> hypervisor support, configure HP StoreVirtual VSA for Block Storage or configure HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage.</li>

	<li>The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements.</li>

	<li>The installer requires the following packages. If they are not found, it will prompt you to install them.
	<ul>
		<li>python-dev</li> 
		<li>libffi-dev</li> 
		<li>libssl-dev </li>
		<li>python-virtualenv</li>
		<li>python-pip</li>

<section id="downloading-the-latest-version-of-hp-helion-development-platform"> <title>Downloading and unpacking the installation file</title>
	<p>The installation of the HP Helion Development Platform for the HP Helion OpenStack Commercial Edition is provided as a small compressed tar file.  The images for the actual services will be downloaded at the installer's request.</p>

	<p><b>Note</b>: Should you need more assistance during installation, the install script also has a help feature.</p>
	<codeblock>
	./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh -h
	</codeblock>
	<p>Register at and download the package from the [HP Helion Development Platform](https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show) (HDN).</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Before you begin the installation, unpack the tar file.
 <codeblock><codeph>
		tar -zxvf DevelopmentPlatform_1.1.0.7.tar.gz
</codeph></codeblock>
		</li>
<li>Navigate to the *dev-platform-installer* directory inside the dev-platform-installer.
<codeblock><codeph>
		cd dev-platform-installer
</codeph></codeblock>
</li>
<li>If your network uses a proxy, it may be necessary to set the *https_proxy* shell variable so that the installer may download required Python libraries from the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. To set the *https_proxy* shell variable, enter the following command:
<codeblock><codeph>
		export https_proxy={ip address or url of http proxy} 
</codeph></codeblock>
	Example:
<codeblock>	<codeph>
		export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com
</codeph></codeblock>		
</li>
<li>
Confirm that you have access to the [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) site. The following commands will verify access to the site and download one of the prerequisite files as a brief test. <b>Note</b>: If *ping* is unavailable, use *wget*.
<codeblock><codeph>
		ping pypi.python.org
		sudo -E pip install python-novaclient
</codeph></codeblock>
</li>
<li>If your network uses a proxy, you must define the proxy exclusion list so that proxies are not used for communicating with the services in the overcloud. To define the proxy exclusion list, enter the following command:
	<codeblock><codeph>
		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone} 
	</codeph></codeblock>		
	Example:
	<codeblock>	<codeph>
		export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.10 
	</codeph></codeblock>		
</li>
<li>
7. Validate Keystone access on port 5000 using *curl*.
<codeblock>	<codeph>
		curl https://{ip address or host name of identity service aka keystone}:5000
</codeph></codeblock>
		<p>Example:</p>
<codeblock><codeph>
		curl https://10.0.0.10:5000
</codeph></codeblock>
</li>
			<li> Run this command to install the Helion Development Platform. You can run this command on any
					machine that can access the Overcloud (it is recommended to run this command on
					the Seed node).<p> By default the Username is *admin* and the Region is
						*regionOne*. Use the admin *tenant_id* from the overcloud. The parameter
							<i>location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt</i> can be found on the Helion
						OpenStack seed VM at
							<i>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ephemeralca-cacert.crt</i>.</p><codeblock>sudo ./DevelopmentPlatform_Setup.sh \
	-p {admin_user_password} \
	-a {auth_host_ip_address} \
	-u {username} \
	-i {tenant_id} \
	-r {region_name} \
	-e {location/ephemeralca-cacert.crt} \
install
</codeblock></li>
		<li>
13. Once the installation is complete, you should see output similar to the following:
 <codeblock>
		2014-06-17 16:53:19.765       INFO Install Complete
		</codeblock>

For ALS to install dependencies for deployed applications, you must provide ALS with outbound Internet connectivity. This process is documented in Step 7 of ["Starting the seed and building your cloud"](http://docs.hpcloud.com/helion/community/install/#startseed) in the baremetal installation instructions.  If an HTTP Proxy is required for Internet downloads, follow the instructions in the [Administration Guide](/helion/devplatform/1.1/als/admin/server/configuration/#http-proxy).

	<section id="install-database"><title>Install the Database Service</title>

This section provides details on installing the Database Service from the Development Platform.
	</section>
	<section id="prerequisites-database"><title>Prerequisites</title>
</section>
	<section id="availability_zones-database"><title>Availability Zones</title>

<p>To configure the Database Service in a highly available manner, it is necessary to create separate availability zones. As a best practice, HP recommends creating three availability zones. All compute hosts should be placed within one of these availability zones. If a compute host is not associated with an availability zone, the Database Service will not be able to provision a database instance to it. As a result, the Database Service may run out of capacity even though there are compute hosts with free capacity.
</p>
<p>The following steps show how to create three availability zones and assign a compute host to the zone.
</p>
<ol><li>Connect to an overcloud controller node and execute the following commands to create three availability zones named: "AZ-1", "AZ-2" and "AZ-3". 
	<codeblock><codeph>
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-1 AZ-1
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-2 AZ-2
		nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-3 AZ-3</codeph></codeblock>
</li>
<li>Validate that the availability zones were correctly created by issuing the following command.
	<codeblock><codeph>
		nova aggregate-list
</codeph></codeblock></li>
<li>The following commands will add a compute host to your newly created availability zones. Issue this command for every compute host that you wish to associate with an availability zone.
	<codeblock><codeph>
		nova aggregate-add-host &lt;id&gt; &lt;hostname&gt;
	</codeph></codeblock>
</li>
	<li>
The following command can be used to list all availability zones and the compute hosts associated with them.
<codeblock><codeph>
		nova availability-zone-list
</codeph></codeblock></li>
</ol>
	</section>
	<section id="quotas-database"><title>Quotas</title>

<p>
	The <b>Database Service</b> will be installed into the admin tenant of the Helion OpenStack overcloud and the admin tenant must have sufficient quota available and unused resources for the service to use. To check existing quota availability, log-in to Horizon as the <b>admin</b> user and open the <b>Overview</b> panel under the <b>Compute</b> tab.
</p><p>
If you are not configuring the Database Service to be highly available you must have the following quota available:
</p>

<p>In addition to the quota mentioned above, for every database instance that is created by a user, the necessary resources to create that instance will be deducted from the admin tenant quota. The users database service quota will also be affected.
